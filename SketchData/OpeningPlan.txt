Fade from black
Camera pans down
Boiler is shown with work
"Boss, we've got a problem"

Boss walks over
"What's up bub?"

"Well, looks like we are about to run out of water."
"What in the jiggery!! We can't stop production of our cans of steam, people need them!" Boss jumps up
"I don't know what to tell you boss...."
"I'll tell you there's no easy way to get water in these arid lands."

From off screen: "I can get you your water."
Boss turns around, camera pans so only he and Barbara are on screen.
"I know of an endless source of known only as the Fountain Of Water. Naught man knows where to it is, but I know how to find it. There is power in the flames you burn, there is energy that can be shifted, shaped, moulded into living beings. Let me touch them and I can birth you one who will find us the fountain of water."
"Fountain of water? I like that. It's got a good ring. You know like "Fountain of water" heh... Okay let's do it, alls well that ends well I suppose. Summon the man!"

Fade to black

The boss and Barbara stand facing a flame.
Runes fly between Barbara and the flame.

The flame goes out.
