Ok to tell you the truth, my boss is an idiot. I know for a fact that the <γ>fountain of water<ψ> doesn't exist. Go to the nearby <γ>library<ψ>, you can read all about it if you don't believe me.
My advice would be just pretend that you're working. I spend most of my days tightening this same bolt while day-dreaming about my wood shop.
