Oh... I remember you. I saw you when I was just a young scientist, so many years ago.
You know, in the beginning of humanity, technology was such a blessing. Clay pots helped us transport water, fire brought us warmth, wood gave us shelter, and spears helped us hunt bigger animals.  
But one day, someone held their spear up high and took aim upon their fellow man. Ever since that day, well... the curse of our intelligence will bury us all.
