<α[0F0F0F]>The joy of jeans. Vol 1.
By William G. Bindersnash
A good pair of jeans starts from the leg, and much like a good long leg, the history of jeans is also very long. The jeans I wear have been passed down in my family for generations. Each fold and crease within tells the story of my family; the slight tear on the left buttock is from when Hartwelt Bindersnash slayed his enemies with his mighty greatsword. The crease on the right thigh is from the late Jimbalthwart Bindersnash, who spent his last 20 years on this earth cross legged. The folds above the ankles are from my brother, Nickompathwart Bindersnash, who was less than 5 feet tall.
To wear generational jeans such as these is not only a lifestyle, but an entire raison d'etre. These jeans are who are I am more than my own genes, if you will pardon the pun. In the next volume, we will discuss the crease behind the left knee cap.
