<α[0F0F0F]>Dr Dok's "Fountain Of Water" 
Vol 1.
Reports on the fountain of water are numerous, and the differences between those accounts are equally numerous. Some have described it's waves measuring above the size of a building, while some say it is little more than a trickle. The only thing in common between these accounts is that the fountain is a source of endless water.
Despite the dubious nature of these accounts, much effort has been put into searching for the fountain. These attempts have never yielded any results. One may conclude that it is then only a rumor, but this writer disagrees.
