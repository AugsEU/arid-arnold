<α[0F0F0F]>Dr Dok's "Fountain Of Water" 
Vol 2.
The many extensive searches for the fountain of water have come up empty handed. This can lead me to only one conclusion: the fountain of water doesn't exist. However, this conclusion doesn't rule out the possibility that the fountain <α[9F0F0F]>once existed<α[0F0F0F]>.
There is evidence to suggest the fountain existed <α[9F0F0F]>long ago<α[0F0F0F]>, and this opinion is slowly becoming the consensus among scholars.
