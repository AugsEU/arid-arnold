<α[0F0F0F]>The Joy of Jeans. Vol 2.
By William G. Bindersnash

If you have read the first volume you will now be familiar with the general outline of the Bindersnash history. Now, let us turn our attention to the crease behind the left knee cap.
This crease was first formed during the daring escape of my great-great-grandfather, Barnabas Bindersnash, from a band of ruthless bandits. He had been chased down for hours that day, his energy almost depleted, he made final attempt at evasion by jumping off a cliff. As he leapt 15 feet in the air, the fabric of his jeans contorted and folded, he bent his left leg back with the majesty of an eagle. Light rays emanated as his body blocked the sun. 
He did not survive the fall but the jeans lived on.
