<α[0F0F0F]>The Joy of Jeans. Vol 3.
By Shenely H. Wonderainy

This book is in memory of my father, William G. Bindersnash. A great man whose mark as been made on this barren earth. Being the last Bindersnash, we laid the family jeans down with him.
He would want everyone who is reading this to know, to cherish your jeans. No longer shall you simply wear them, but you shall embrace them as a tangible link to your past, a canvas upon which your own story unfolds. If you do that, you may too find... the joy of jeans.
