<α[0F0F0F]>The Joy of Jeans. Vol 3.
By Shenely H. Wonderainy

This poem is in memory of my father, William G. Bindersnash. A great man whose mark has been made on this barren earth. Being the last Bindersnash, we laid the family jeans down with him.
"Find three shrooms, go ahead,
They hide behind golden head.
From behind them still, from left to right,
A jump you will, and find in sight
The buried jeans of our dead."
