<Σα[AAAAAA]0210>Are you one of them? Come here to finish off what's left of me... No, you have <α[8E5CC4]>Great Witch Barbara's<Σα[AAAAAA]0210> blessing I can see. And you seek the <γ>fountain of water<Σα[AAAAAA]0210> to boot?
My Kingdom used to hold that fountain. But it was destroyed long ago, with the rest of my home. I managed to escape to this cave. If you want to search the ruins of our great Kingdom, you'll have to leave this cave then travel through <γ>The Land Of Mirrors<Σα[AAAAAA]0210>. Don't expect to find anything though...
Where once there was hope, there is this. Lying in the depths waiting for death to overtake me.
