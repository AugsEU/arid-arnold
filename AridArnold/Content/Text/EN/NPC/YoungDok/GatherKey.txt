...A human visitor I see. You are here to claim the <γ>fountain of water<ψ>. You are in the right place, and yet, you need to venture to another place... in time. The gate blocks your path, only a key forged in the <γ>fires of hell<ψ> can open it. For now we rest in heaven, cradled by serenity. Only in the <γ>far far future<ψ> will the flames burn strong, and we will writhe in <γ>hell<ψ>.
