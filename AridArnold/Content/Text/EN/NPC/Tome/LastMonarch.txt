<α[121314]>KING NOTOTHEN SILLAGO CXXIV-CXCV

Hear these words...
I was the last monarch of this kingdom, my reign was to oversee its demise. 
I am not deserving of an epitaph, so I shall echo the words of KING ALFONSINO:
Those who are young will <α[371647]>age forwards in time<α[121314]>.
Those who are old will <α[371647]>age backwards in time<α[121314]>.
