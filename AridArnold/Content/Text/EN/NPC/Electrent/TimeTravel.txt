-- Mechanics of time travel --
To travel in time is every person's dream, yet you are a fool for doing so since we already travel in time. Every day we travel 24 hours forward in time. The real issue is that we also age 24 hours. Consider these two separate concepts, and graph time on the x-axis and age on the y-axis. As we go through our pitiful lives, we travel along a 45 degree line travelling from P1 to P2, aging in equal parts to time travelled.

Now consider my marvellous time-machine extraordinaire. Step foot in this machine and you will travel horizontally, moving in time without aging, going from P1 to P3. If you were to then age from there on, you would further travel to P4. This machine is incapable of going backwards in time however, but my hope is this will be invented in the future. 

Does this mean that in the future we may be able to come back to our youth? No. Consider once again the sad life of one who has no time machine, starting at P1 they age to P2. If they were to then step in a backwards time machine, they would travel to P5. They are still old but back where they started in time. Please, I pray that you don't forget the difference between aging and time travel.
