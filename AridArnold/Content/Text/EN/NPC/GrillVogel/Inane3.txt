There's a raccoon around these parts that calls herself <γ>Zippy<ψ>, she told me how fast she was, and all these weird tips. Did she not realise she was talking to a big golden head? How am I going to use these tips? I can't! Anyway, it got me thinking, because I have never seen her move an inch. Not so fast are you then?
