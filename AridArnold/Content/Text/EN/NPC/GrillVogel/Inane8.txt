But hey, let me tell you about a little scheme I came up with to save some cash on my water bill. You see, water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen, right? So I got to thinking, what if I bought them separately and then combined them myself at home?
I did some research and found out that you can actually buy hydrogen and oxygen in tanks, just like propane or other gases. So I went ahead and bought a couple of tanks, and then set up a little system to combine them into water.
At first, I have to admit, it was kind of fun. There's something satisfying about being able to make your own water, but, after a while, I started to realize that it was a lot more work than I had anticipated. I had to constantly monitor the pressure and make sure that the right amounts of each gas were being combined. Plus, it was kind of dangerous, since both hydrogen and oxygen are highly flammable.
And when all was said and done, I realized that I wasn't really saving that much money anyway. The cost of the tanks and the equipment I had to buy ended up being more than I would have saved on my water bill.
