Once, I met an extraterrestrial being named Buk. This little guy had quite a story to tell, let me tell you.
Buk came from a planet far, far away, and he was a master builder. He had the ability to create anything he could imagine, just by using the power of his mind. And one day, he decided to use that power to create a system of underground caves.
Some say that the rat-like creatures running around here are distant descendants of Buk's kind.
