Listen up, pal, I'm about to let you in on a little secret that's been making me some serious cash. You see, a while back, I had an idea to set up two phone companies right here in the cave. But not just any phone companies - these were special. They had pay-per-minute numbers that would call each other in an endless loop, generating free money for me.
It's simple, really. I've got one phone on one side of the cave that's connected to one of my phone companies, and another phone on the other side of the cave that's connected to the other. When someone calls the pay-per-minute number on one phone, it automatically calls the pay-per-minute number on the other, and vice versa. The longer the calls go on, the more money I make. And the best part? I don't have to do a thing. It's all automated.
Now, you might be wondering how I got away with this without anyone catching on. Well, let's just say I've got some tricks up my sleeve. I made sure to register the phone numbers under fake names and set up a bunch of fake businesses to make it look like the calls were legitimate. And so far, it's been working like a charm.
