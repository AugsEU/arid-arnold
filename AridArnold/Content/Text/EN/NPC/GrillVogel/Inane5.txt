I once saw a famous celebrity, and I won't say who it was, trying to make off with a handful of chocolate bars from a supermarket. Can you imagine that? A celebrity, who's got more money than they know what to do with, trying to steal candy like a common criminal!
When people started calling him out and telling him to put the candy back, he just kept yawning and pretending like he couldn't hear them. He finally got dragged back to the cashier, who wanted to just put the number into the computer. But this guy really demanded they be scanned individually, in order to prevent "electrical comfubulation". What an idiot! I don't think that's even a real word.
