You see, I've always been fascinated by the story of King Midas, and his ability to turn anything he touched into gold. But as I grew older, my admiration turned into a full-blown obsession. I wanted to be like Midas, to have that kind of power and influence.
So one day, I decided to take the ultimate step. I went to a place that specialized in gold plating and asked them to encase my entire head in the shiny metal. They thought I was crazy, of course, but I was willing to pay any price for the chance to become like the great Midas himself.
When they finished, I have to admit, I looked pretty impressive. My entire head was covered in a layer of gleaming gold. But as I walked out of the shop, I noticed something strange. People were staring at me, pointing and whispering to each other. And then it hit me: I had become the richest person in the world, when you account for the weight of my gold head.
Suddenly, doors started opening for me that I never thought possible. But I didn't want that, no sir! That's why I went to this here cave to become a hermit.
