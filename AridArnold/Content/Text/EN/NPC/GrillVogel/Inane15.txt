You know, pal, I've been trying to solve this Rubik's Cube for weeks now. But then I came up with the brilliant idea of just peeling off the stickers and rearranging them. But now I've got a new problem - I can't seem to figure out which sticker goes where.
Can you help me figure out the correct order for these stickers? I promise I'll make it worth your while. Heck, I'll even throw in a few of my best chairs if you can finally solve this puzzle for me.
