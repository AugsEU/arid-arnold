But how about this for a mundane tale, I was dealing with some serious back problems. No matter what I did, the pain just wouldn't go away. I tried everything from massages to painkillers, but nothing seemed to do the trick.
So one day, I had a crazy idea. I thought to myself, "What if I just got rid of my back entirely?" And before I knew it, I was down in the basement, digging through my toolbox for a saw.
I won't go into too much detail, pal, but let's just say that removing your own back is not an easy feat. It took me hours of sawing, slicing, and grunting before I finally managed to get the thing off. And let me tell you, when I stood up for the first time without a back, it was a strange feeling. Like I was lighter than air, but also missing a vital part of my body.
Of course, once the initial shock wore off, I realised that I'd made a bit of a mistake. Well I've been stuck here ever since.
