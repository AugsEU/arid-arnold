For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to become a lawyer. I know it's an unconventional career choice for someone living in a cave like me. Well I tried to pass the bar but the stuck-up people at the university told me I need to be able to read if I want to become a lawyer. What kind of strange rule is that?
Anyway, I said "To hell with that!" and I told them that I could read, even though I can't. It was all going well at the lectures, when suddenly the lecturer asked me a question. I was stumped, I didn't know what they were talking about. In a moment of quick thinking, I told him I couldn't see because I had bad eyesight, and it worked like a charm. They didn't suspect a thing.
Well not until they asked me to take an eye exam, I said I couldn't see any of the letters, but only because I don't know what their silly little names are. Anyway, long story short, I got declared legally blind. Turns out blind people can't be lawyers either. Now that's discrimination!
