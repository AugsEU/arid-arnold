You have done well to get this far. You've found my favourite spot to watch the falling leaves. Though they may be beautiful, they also represent the decay of my home. Each one is a part of this land that's died. Don't worry my child, decay is the natural order. Eventually, this world will be nothing but a <γ>hellscape<ψ>. Watching these leaves fall is only a small part of that, and it's perhaps why they're so beautiful.
