So you want to go fast? You want to be like old Zippy here?
Boy have I got some Σα[FF6D0A]0508HOTψ tips for you. Of course, you can't have all the tips at once. I've gotta make a living here, I'm not running some sort of charity ya galoomba!

Ready? Tip #1:
When you play a level you have already beat, you'll see the ghost of your fastest performance for that level. At the end of the level, it will show you the time difference of between you and the ghost.

That's all for Zippy's tips.
