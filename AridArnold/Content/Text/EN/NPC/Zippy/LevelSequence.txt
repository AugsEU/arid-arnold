Name's <γ>Zippy<ψ>, you look new around here. Like you were born yesterday, no no like you were born today! <Σα[FFFFFF]0508>HAHAHA<ψ>...
Well let me give you a tip: if you see a door with a number on it, that number is how many levels are behind that door.

So if a door has a 3 on it, that means there's 3 levels behind it. Complete all 3, and you keep the rewards.
Alls you have to do is press {Key.Confirm} to open them, then you're off to the races my boy!
