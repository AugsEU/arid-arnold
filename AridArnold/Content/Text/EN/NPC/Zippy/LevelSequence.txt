Name's <γ>Zippy<ψ>, you look new around here. Like you were born yesterday, no no like you were born today!
Well let me give you a tip: if you see a door with a number on it, that number is how many levels are behind that door.

So if a door has a 3 on it, it means there's 3 levels behind that door. If you run out of lives you get kicked out, but if you complete the levels you get to keep the rewards.
Alls you have to do is press [{Key.Confirm}] to open them then you're off to the races my boy.
