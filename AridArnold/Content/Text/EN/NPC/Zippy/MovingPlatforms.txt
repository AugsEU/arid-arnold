So I said to the guy "What's the deal with moving platforms?". Everyone erupted in laughter... Heheh. Oh yeah you wanted some advice, right.
<γ>Tip #3<ψ>:
When jumping off a <γ>moving platform<ψ> you won't carry any momentum. This makes the standing vertical jump a good option for navigating them, as you will go straight up.
