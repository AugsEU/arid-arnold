Hey hey hey hey hey...
Err what's your deal, hanging around in a place like this? I mean, the heat isn't bad for a guy like me, made of stone. But you dude? Looks toasty is all I'm saying. Like, this place is known for the <γ>infernal forge<ψ> below.
One last thing, I know I'm a friendly guy but you should look out for my brothers. They've got some big problems I can't work out.
